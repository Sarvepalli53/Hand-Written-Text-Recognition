# Hand-Written-Text-Recognition
The project aims at converting text written with hand into digital text by using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
In this project we proposed a method for the identification of hand written text. The model consists of CNN and RNN layers consecutively and end point layer is CTC layer. The images in the dataset are pre-processed and fed to the CNN layer the outputs of CNN are given to RNN and to decode the RNN layer outputs CTC layer is used. The results obtained shows that the hybrid model of CNN and RNN works well for text recognition.
